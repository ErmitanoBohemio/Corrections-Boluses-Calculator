> App calculadora bolos de corrección ante Hiperglicemias/Hiperglucemias en personas con diabetes que usan insulina rápida para sus dosis de corrección.
## APPLICATION INFORMATION
This app allows you to calculate the recommended “correction dose” to fix blood sugars that are above target. This adjustment improves your chances of having a blood sugar reading that is within your target range before the next meal.

Your target blood sugar should be a single number near the midpoint of your acceptable target range usually this target blood is 120 mg/dl or 140 mg/dl.

## CHARACTERISTICS

 - Calculating the recommended correction dose requires four basic user data such as TDD (Total Daily Dose), current blood glucose, target glucose and ISF (Insulin Sensitivity Factor) or, failing that, recent HbA1c (Glycosylated Hemoglobin) result. 
 - If the ISF (Sensitivity or Correction Factor) is not known, the app estimates it from the average glucose obtained from a recent HbA1c test and the user's TDD.  
 - Approximate correction insulin requirements based on CGM trends arrows. 
 -  Approximate correction insulin requirements based on blood ketone levels  
 - Correction bolus notice prior to sports practice, to which the app recommends half the amount of correction dose that you would normally take.  
 - If user reports glucose goes low or falls more than 30 mg/dl  Within 3 hours after correction bolus, app raise FSI by about 10% to make correction boluses smaller.  
 - If user reports glucose remains more than 30 mg/dl above your target after 3 hours correction bolus, application decreses FSI by approximately 10% lower to make correction boluses larger.

## Information required for the App
The information required to calculate the correction dose or the recommended correction dose is not stored in any way, so be sure to make a note of what you need to back up for future reference.
> Mandatory:
- **TDD (Total Dialy Dose)**: total daily insulin, including basal and bolus insulin.
- **BG Current:** current blood sugar in ml/dL.
- **BG Target:**  target blood sugar in ml/dL.
- **Sensitivity Factor or Hb1Ac test:** your sensitivity factor is how much each unit of insulin is expected to lower your blood sugar, or A recent HbA1c test.

> Optional:
- **Sports and Exercise:** when you are going to perform aerobic/cardiovascular exercise after a rapid acting insulin bolus, reducing usual correction bolus at 50% is almost always in order; If ketones are present, exercise should be avoided.
- **Frequent Hypoglycemia after correction:** raise your ISF number by about 10% to make correction boluses smaller.
- **Frequent Hyperglycemia after correction:** reduce your ISF number by about 10% to make correction boluses bigger.
- **Trend Arrows:** gives suggestions for initial bolus adjustments to try based on the CGM trend arrows
- **Ketones level:** approximate correction insulin requirements based on blood ketone levels.
